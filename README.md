### Why Use This Repo Over Others?
#### 1. It has the most python code exercises of any repo on Github, and they're *EASILY SEARCHABLE*.
#### 2. The code exercises are *ACTUALLY DOCUMENTED AND EXPLAINED*.
#### 3. You can easily *TEST YOURSELF* with the `test_yourself.py` script*.
#### 4. All the code exercises have *SOLUTIONS*, with code comment explanations included.
#### 4. All the code in this repo has *UNIT TESTING* for you to verify against. It also checks the *solutions* code.

# SETUP AND USAGE

Either *fork* or *clone* this repo, and you are good to go! There are `<problem-name>-answer.py` files to add your solutions, and these are found in `/solutions/<problem-name>/`.

Dependencies have been avoided and should be in the future, so now `pip` installing need be done. It's standard library or nothing.

# ADDITIONAL

#### Searching For Exercises

Run `python search_and_launch.py your search terms here` to return a list of exercises whose *tags* match your terms.

#### Tags?

I am tagging all exercises, because maybe you want to work on *graph-search* algorithms specifically and who wants to search through 100 problem folders just going off the folder name. Tags are found in the *problem answer file* which are located at `/problems/<problem-name>/<problem-name>-answer.py`

# FAQ & TROUBLESHOOT

#### What's Housekeeping For?

This repo already contains a lot of problems, and thus a lot of files and supporting files. It's only going to get bigger, so I'm working on some basic scripts to manage the repo's 'health' and to track its growth.

Other things related to the repo but not the questions and exercises directly are in here to. Like the [CONTRIBUTING.md](/Housekeeping/CONTRIBUTING.md) file and the [LICENSE](/housekeeping/LICENSE) and the [TODO.md](/housekeeping/TODO.md).

#### Why Am I Seeing C++ In Here?

When you need speed and a deeper understanding of a problem Python can be a too slow and too 'high-level'. Where it's useful I aim to include C++ solutions (or maybe Java, C) to show a solution that is efficient and doesn't hide away some of the complexity.
